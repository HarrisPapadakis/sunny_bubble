// Title: Simple Arcade Game - Number Guessing Game
// Description: The player guesses a number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

// Welcome message
echo "=== Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! ===\n";

// Generate a random number between 1 and 100
$randomNumber = rand(1, 100);

// Initialize variables
$attempts = 0; // Tracks the number of attempts
$guessedCorrectly = false; // Flag to check if the player has guessed correctly

// Start the game loop
while (!$guessedCorrectly) {
    // Prompt the player to enter a guess
    echo "Enter your guess (1-100): ";
    $guess = trim(fgets(STDIN)); // Read player input and remove whitespace

    // Increment the attempt counter
    $attempts++;

    // Check if the input is numeric
    if (!is_numeric($guess)) {
        echo "Please enter a valid number.\n";
        continue;
    }

    // Convert the guess to an integer
    $guess = (int)$guess;

    // Check if the guess is correct
    if ($guess === $randomNumber) {
        echo "Congratulations! You guessed the number correctly in $attempts attempts!\n";
        $guessedCorrectly = true; // End the loop
    } elseif ($guess < $randomNumber) {
        echo "Too low! Try again.\n";
    } else {
        echo "Too high! Try again.\n";
